# 1.1 How Models Work?
Your cousin has made millions of dollars speculating on real estate. He's offered to become business partners with you because of your interest in data science. He'll supply the money, and you'll supply models that predict how much various houses are worth.

You ask your cousin how he's predicted real estate values in the past, and he says it is just intuition. But more questioning reveals that he's identified price patterns from houses he has seen in the past, and he uses those patterns to make predictions for new houses he is considering.

Machine learning works the same way. We'll start with a model called the Decision Tree. There are fancier models that give more accurate predictions. But ***decision trees*** are easy to understand, and they are the basic building block for some of the best models in data science

***df is divided into 2 categories:***
- more than 2 bedrooms -YES -NO

This step of capturing patterns from data is called ***fitting or training the model***

### how to improve decision tree
You can capture more factors using a tree that has more "splits." These are called "deeper" trees. A decision tree that also considers the total size of each house's lot might look like this:

***the bottom in the prediction is called ("leaf")***
